@par Demo Description

This directory contains binary files (*.hex) of the STM32F303RE-Nucleo
Demonstration firmware. 
You can use any in-system programming tool to reprogram the demonstration 
using these binary files, as described below:

 + Using "in-system programming tool"
    - Connect the STM32F303RE-Nucleo board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B'
      cable through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
    - Make sure that the embedded ST-LINK/V2 is configured for in-system programming
      (Both CN2 jumpers ON)
    - Use "STM32CubeF3_Demo_STM32F303RE-Nucleo.hex" binary with your preferred 
      in-system programming tool to reprogram the demonstration firmware 
      (ex. STM32 ST-LINK Utility, available for download from www.st.com).
